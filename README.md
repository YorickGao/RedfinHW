# Food truck data from the San Francisco governmentâ€™s API
This is a command line program that prints out a list of food trucks that are open at the current date and current time, when the program is being run. So if I run the program at noon on a Friday, I should see a list of all the food trucks that are open then.
- To run the program on Ubuntu or Max OSX:
- Go to program folder:
    ```
    cd RedfinHW
    ```
- Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    - Run the program:
    ```
    node FoodTruckFinder.js
    ```
